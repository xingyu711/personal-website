Hi! You have done a real good job on this project. It is well-organized and displays impressive information of yourself. Besides, it is quite responsive to different devices of various width and resolution. I am not going to contribute codes as I am a green hand myself, so I would like to give some advices on the theme design.

In my opinion, removing the background image and leaving it pure black is not a good way in designing. The usage of black, white versus pink produces a really high contrast, which is not reader-friendly enough. You may set a semi-transparent background image of either yourself, your dog :D , or just some texture.

Besides, I find your repo relatively big. It is your gallery that contribute to most of the size (~40 MB). You may compress those images in that most of the time the reader will not need to access a full-size image.

I am sorry that I am not able to provide advices on the codes. It is a nice work. Thanks for reading.
